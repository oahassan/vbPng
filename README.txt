vbPng is a libary for reading and writing png image files.  It's written in VB .NET under the .NET 2.0 framework.  It's built to support png 1.2 specification, however, it does have some limitations. For example, images cannot be larger than 2147483646 pixels in height or width.  I'll be updating with more complete information soon.
